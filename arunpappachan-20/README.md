📘 Project Title
Simulating Cache Memory Mapping and Replacement Algorithms Using Git Collaboration
📝 Project Description

This project focuses on designing and simulating:

Cache Mapping Techniques

Direct Mapping

Fully Associative Mapping

Set-Associative Mapping

Page Replacement Algorithms

FIFO

LRU

Optimal

The goal is to understand memory management concepts in computer architecture and apply them using Python programming.
Git and GitHub were used for branching, merging, version control, and team collaboration.

🚀 Features

Python implementations of mapping and replacement policies

Menu-driven interface

Flowcharts and workflow diagrams

Sample inputs and outputs

Collaborative Git workflow



🛠️ Technologies Used

Python (Simulation)

Git & GitHub (Collaboration)

Canva (Workflow Diagrams)

Markdown (Documentation)

📄 How to Run the Program
